# Welcome to the Java Guild!

As members of the Java Guild, you will be working through the challenges of TwilioQuest using the Java programming language and the [Spark Framework](http://sparkjava.com/).  This project is pre-configured to have some interesting functionality built in using the Twilio Java helper library.

## Setting Up

Before you can run this project, you will need to set three system environment variables.  These are:

* `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` : Your Twilio "account SID" - it's like your username for the Twilio API.  This and the auth token (below) can be found [on the console](https://www.twilio.com/console).
* `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` : Your Twilio "auth token" - it's your password for the Twilio API.  This and the account SID (above) can be found [on the console](https://www.twilio.com/console).
* `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` : A Twilio number that you own, that can be used for making calls and sending messages.  You can find a list of phone numbers you control (and buy another one, if necessary) [in the account portal](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming).

For Mac and Linux, environment variables can be set by opening a terminal window and typing the following three commands - replace all the characters after the `=` with values from your Twilio account:

    export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACXXXXXXXXX
    export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXX
    export TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+16518675309

To make these changes persist for every new terminal (on OS X), you can edit the file `~/.bash_profile` to contain the three commands above.  This will set these environment variables for every subsequent session. Once you have edited the file to contain these commands, run `source ~/.bash_profile` in the terminal to set up these variables.

On Windows, the easiest way to set permanent environment variables (as of Windows 8) is using the `setx` command.  Note that there is no `=`, just the key and value separated by a space:

    setx TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID ACXXXXXXXXX
    setx TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN XXXXXXXXX
    setx TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER +16518675309

## Running the Application
Now that our project is ready, we need to build it using [maven](https://maven.apache.org/):

```
./mvnw clean install
```

Start the application:
```
java -jar target/twilio-playground-with-dependencies.jar 
```

Now you can visit [http://localhost:9080/](http://localhost:9080)

Try out the text message and voice call demos by entering your mobile phone number and clicking the button.  If you receive a text message and a call, everything is working!

## Begin Questing!
This is but your first step into a larger world.  [Return to TwilioQuest](http://quest.twilio.com) to continue your adventure.  Huzzah!
